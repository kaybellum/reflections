When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

A remote repository would be helpful in the event that you want to collaborate 
with other people on a project; remotes are also beneficial as a backup I'd 
imagine.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A collaborator might introduce a change on the remote repository that you don't
approve of. Also, you may end up with far too many unnecessary commits. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Branches are made within a repository. By cloning, a repository is pulled off 
of the remote Github server and copied to your local drive. Clones can also be 
made of existing local repositories to another destination on your local drive 
or another local drive. Forks occur only on the Github server; they allow you 
to take someone else's work and create a separate copy of it so that you can 
make modifications independently of what they're doing. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

By storing the last-known state of a remote locally, you will be able to make 
changes to it whilst other collaborators make their own changes. You can then 
merge your changes with theirs once you are all satisfied with your progress.
