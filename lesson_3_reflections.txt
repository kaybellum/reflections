When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

A remote repository would be helpful in the event that you want to collaborate 
with other people on a project; remotes are also beneficial as a backup I'd 
imagine.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A collaborator might introduce a change on the remote repository that you don't
approve of. Also, you may end up with far too many unnecessary commits.
