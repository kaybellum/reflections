What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

By using the "git init" command, a new git repository is created in the working
directory. You'll know that a git repository has been created if running the 
command "ls -a" (or, alternatively, "ls --all") lists a ".git" directory in the
output. In order to add version control to your work, git init must be 
employed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The "working directory" is just a folder on your computer. This directory can 
be turned into a "git repository" using the "git init" command. Once you have a
git repository initialized in a working directory, you can make commits. Git 
provides a feature known as the "staging area" that serves as a queue of the 
files you wish to add to your next commit.
